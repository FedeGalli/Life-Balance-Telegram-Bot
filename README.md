# Life-Balance-Telegram-Bot

<br /><br />This project aims to build a personal finance tracker using Google SpreadSheet API and telegram bot.
By using the telegram bot we can add incomes and expenses under user custom categories. Then this data will be send to the associated google spreadsheet to manage all the calculations.

<br />To deploy the project you just need to run the telegram bot server (main.py file), and add the keys to the Google Tecnical Account (to write on the sheet) and the link to the sheet itself.
